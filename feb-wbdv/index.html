<!-- Tags -->

<h1>Header Tag - this is an H1 the largest tag - h1 - h6 the smallest </h1>
<p> the paragraph tag </p>

<!-- there are self-closing tags  like <input /> or <image />
tags can and should be NESTED

<div>
    <h1></h1>
</div> 

A div is short for division - generic container like a cardboard box - 
useful for CSS for grouping things/content together that will have the same CSS rulse applied 
-->

<div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: red;"></div>

<!-- span – A container for small pieces of text. If a div is like a cardboard box, a span is like a Ziploc bag. It doesn't change the styling of anything by itself but it allows you use CSS and JavaScript later to make that text different in some way. Example: <p>Here is some text. <span>This text is in a span</span> but it doesn't look any different.</p>-->

<p>This is <span style="text-decoration: underline">important</span> text</p>

<!-- ol - ordered list, ul - unordered list-->
<ol>
    <li>The First One</li>
    <li>The Second One</li>
    <li>The Third One</li>
  </ol>
  
  <ul>
    <li>An Item in the List</li>
    <li>Another Item in the List</li>
    <li>A Yet Different Item in the List</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- buttons just displays a button but requires JS to do something-->
  <button>Click me! I don't do anything</button>

  <!-- image tag/element
img – An image. You use this to load images onto the page. This can be confusing because you can use CSS to bring in images too. The key difference is that when the image is apart of the content, like a diagram that shows data you're talking about or a picture that shows something from the article, it should be an img tag. If it's a nice background image or something that's for decoration of your website, use CSS. An img tag needs a src to say where the image is coming from and alt to say what is in the image for screen readers so that the image will still be useful to blind people, people who are hard of seeing, and Google and Bing search engines. img are always self-closing tags. Example: <img src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog25.jpg" alt="an adorable dog" />-->

<img
     src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog25.jpg"
     alt="an adorable puppy"
     />
<img
     src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog26.jpg"
     alt="an adorable puppy"
     />
<img
     src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog27.jpg"
     alt="an adorable puppy"
     />
