<!-- Tags -->

<h1>Header Tag - this is an H1 the largest tag - h1 - h6 the smallest </h1>
<p> the paragraph tag </p>

<!-- there are self-closing tags  like <input /> or <image />
tags can and should be NESTED

<div>
    <h1></h1>
</div> 

A div is short for division - generic container like a cardboard box - 
useful for CSS for grouping things/content together that will have the same CSS rulse applied 
-->

<div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: red;"></div>

<!-- span – A container for small pieces of text. If a div is like a cardboard box, a span is like a Ziploc bag. It doesn't change the styling of anything by itself but it allows you use CSS and JavaScript later to make that text different in some way. Example: <p>Here is some text. <span>This text is in a span</span> but it doesn't look any different.</p>-->

<p>This is <span style="text-decoration: underline">important</span> text</p>

<!-- ol - ordered list, ul - unordered list-->
<ol>
    <li>The First One</li>
    <li>The Second One</li>
    <li>The Third One</li>
  </ol>
  
  <ul>
    <li>An Item in the List</li>
    <li>Another Item in the List</li>
    <li>A Yet Different Item in the List</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- buttons just displays a button but requires JS to do something-->
  <button>Click me! I don't do anything</button>

  <!-- image tag/element
img – An image. You use this to load images onto the page. This can be confusing because you can use CSS to bring in images too. The key difference is that when the image is apart of the content, like a diagram that shows data you're talking about or a picture that shows something from the article, it should be an img tag. If it's a nice background image or something that's for decoration of your website, use CSS. An img tag needs a src to say where the image is coming from and alt to say what is in the image for screen readers so that the image will still be useful to blind people, people who are hard of seeing, and Google and Bing search engines. img are always self-closing tags. Example: <img src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog25.jpg" alt="an adorable dog" />-->

<img
     src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog25.jpg"
     alt="an adorable puppy"
     />
<img
     src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog26.jpg"
     alt="an adorable puppy"
     />
<img
     src="http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog27.jpg"
     alt="an adorable puppy"
     />

<!-- input tags/elements
input – Browser inputs. Sometimes you need to gather input from the user. Luckily for us, the browser is already really good at doing that. It gives us several types of inputs that you can use. One of the most common ones is the text input, seen here: 
you can type in me
. You can also have these input tags do numbers, dates, colors, checkboxes, radio buttons, and others. 
We'll explore them more later when we talk about forms. Inputs are always self-closing tags. Example: <input />. -->

 <!-- these are the same, type="text" is the default -->
<input />
<input type="text" />

<input type="color" />
<input type="file" />
<input type="number" />
<input type="datetime-local" />
<input type="radio" />
<input type="checkbox" />

<!-- text area element
textarea – Similar to an input but for a lot more text. 
You'd type long-form responses in here that could linebreaks in it (a linebreak happens when you hit "return" or "enter" on your keyboard.) 
Despite never having anything inside of a textarea, it is not a self-closing tag. 
HTML is a really old language and so we have to live with some old quirks. Example: <textarea></textarea>
-->

<textarea></textarea>

<!-- select tag/element
select and option — Sometimes you want to limit a user to a certain group of options to select from. What country you're from, what month you were born in, etc. 
A select is a user-interactive input that a user can select an option from a dropdown menu. An option is one of the available options. 
Each option needs a value that will be sent back to the server if the user select that option. What's inside of the option is what shown to the user. 
Example: <select><option value="seattle">Seattle</option><option value="portland">Portland</option><option value="san-francisco">San Francisco</option></select>
-->

<select>
  <option value="seattle">Seattle</option>
  <option value="portland">Portland</option>
  <option value="san-francisco">San Francisco</option>
</select>


<!-- form element/tag

form – A group of html tags related to gathering data from a user. This will be some combination of input, textarea, and select tags. 
You can then use this form element to send that data to your server. A form tag itself doesn't show anything; 
it's a just a container for the other tags. We'll use them more later. For now, just know they exist. Example: <form><input /><textarea></textarea></form> -->

<form>
  <input placeholder="First Name" />
  <input placeholder="Last Name" />
</form>

<!-- table, tr, and td – Like making a table in Word or Excel. If you have a table of data, this is the best way to display it. 
  Just for your context, we used to do terrible, awful things with tables to make websites, way back when. 
  Because of that, some tutorial will tell you never ever use tables. 
  That's not good either because when you have tabular data (something you would put into Excel) then tables are very useful. 
  The table is the container for the whole table, tr represents a row, and td represents one cell in the table. 
  Example: <table><tr><td>(0,0)</td><td>(1,0)</td></tr><tr><td>(0,1)</td><td>(1,1)</td></tr></table> -->

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Names</td>
        <td>Points</td>
      </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Ravenclaw</td>
        <td>50</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Slytherin</td>
        <td>60</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
