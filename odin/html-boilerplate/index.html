<!-- Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration. The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- This is what’s known as the root element of the document, meaning that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it.This becomes more important later on when we learn about manipulating HTML with JavaScript. For now, just know that the HTML element should be included on every HTML document.
lang specifies the language of the text content in that element. This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage. It allows assistive technologies, for example screen readers, to adapt according to the language and invoke correct pronunciation.
-->
<html lang="en">

<!-- The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser. Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.-->
  
  <head>
<!-- The charset meta element
We should always have the meta tag for the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element: <meta charset="utf-8">.Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
<!--Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the title element:

<title>My First Webpage</title>

The title element is used to give webpages a human-readable title which is displayed in our webpage’s browser tab.

If we didn’t include a title element, the webpage’s title would default to its file name. In our case that would be index.html, which isn’t very meaningful for users; this would make it very difficult to find our webpage if the user has many browser tabs open.-->
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <!-- The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the <body> element. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.

    To complete the boilerplate, add a body element to the index.html file. The body element also goes within the HTML element and is always below the head element, -->
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>



<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html> -->
