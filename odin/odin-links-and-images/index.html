    <!-- You may have noticed that we snuck in the rel attribute above. This attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.

The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.
Note that you may be fine if you forget to add rel="noopener noreferrer" since more recent versions of browsers provide this security if only target="_blank" is present. Nevertheless, in line with good coding practices and to err on the side of caution, it is recommended to always pair a target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer".
